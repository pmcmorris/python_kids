# Setup

Before you can use a computer for programming, you need to set it up with the tools you need. Depending on the type of programming you want to do, this can be a bit tricky. But for Python, this is fairly simple. But the good news is that you only need to do this setup once.

What you need
1. Install Python
    Do you already have the Python language installed on your computer? You'll need this before we can run any of the programs. I might add some instructions later. But for now, ask a parent to get some help setting this up.
2. Install a text editor
    For now I'll just assume that you've already installed VS Code.
3. Sync the repository to your machine
