# The Basics

This folder holds a series of very small example programs.
Each one tries to only introduce a single topic.
The programs are ordered from simple to more complex using name prefixes (`01_hello.py`, `02_comments.py`, `03_statements.py`).
Feel free to read them in any order you want.
But if you ever get confused, don't worry.
Just go back and read the earlier examples until you find the missing idea.
