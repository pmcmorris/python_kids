# Comments

Source: [[02_comments.py](../../code/basics/02_comments.py)]

This example shows how to use comments.
`Comments` are notes that programers leave in the code.

Comment in Python start with a `#` character.
Anything from that character to the end of the line is a comment.

```
# This is a comment
```

Comments don't "execute".
The Python interpreter that runs your program will just ignore them.
So they don't change the behavior of a running program.

When you run this program, the output will be the same as hello even though the source file is different.
This is because the code is the same.
Comments aren't really code.
They're just mixed in there with the code.

# Why use comments

But even if they don't do anything, they're still useful.
You can use them to help explain what the code does, how it works, or anything you think you might want to know later.

You can also use them to temporarily disable a line of code.
Put a '#' at the start of the line and it wont execute anymore.
Delete it and it will start working again.
This might be handy if the line contains something useful that you might want later and don't want to delete and lose.
