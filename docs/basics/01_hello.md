# Hello

Source: [[01_hello.py](../../code/basics/01_hello.py)]

This is one of the simplest programs.
It should just write "Hello World!" to the console when you run it.
But there are a bunch of new concepts in this program that we haven't explained yet.
But don't worry if it doesn't make prefect sense yet.
Just make sure you can run it and see the expected output.

On Windows:
```
python code\basics\01_hello.py
```

On Linux:
```
python3 code/basics/01_hello.py
```

Output:
```
hello
```
