# Introduction

Welcome to Python Kids!

The is where you'll find tutorials for young kids looking to get into programming.  How old is old enough to code?  If you can read then you can learn to program computers.

If this is your first time here then you might need to follow the [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md) first.

Let's get started!

# Quick Start

Let's run some code!

1. The first thing we'll wan't to do is open a command prompt. You can do this by pessing the Windows key and typing `cmd` and pressing Enter.

2. Next change directory into the concepts directory

```
cd python_kids/code/01_basics
```
3. Run one of the examples

`python 01_hello.py`

4. Open the source code in your text editor and read the code. See if you can figure it out how it works.

# Structure

This repository is a collection of code and documentation. It's structured to introduce new concept one at a time and add them very slowly.

- [Basics](docs/basics.md): This is the best place for newcomers to start
- [Tutorials](docs/tutorials.md): These are small watch throughs that introduce a topic
- [Projects](docs/projects.md): These are larger programs that apply skills from basics and tutorials
